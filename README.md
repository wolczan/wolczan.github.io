# Portfolio Website
I have created a portfolio website to showcase my skills, experience, and projects.

Project Overview is designed to provide an overview of my professional experience and showcase my projects. The website is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is hosted on Github Pages.

The website consists of several pages:

Home page: Brief introduction to who I am and what I do. It includes links to my social media profiles and a contact form. About page: This page provides more detailed information about my background, skills, and experience. Projects page: This page showcases some of my projects and includes links to their Github repositories and live demos. Blog page: This page contains some of my writing on topics related to my field of work. Contact page: This page includes a contact form that visitors can use to get in touch with me.

Alternatively, you can clone the repository to your local machine and open the index.html file in your web browser.
